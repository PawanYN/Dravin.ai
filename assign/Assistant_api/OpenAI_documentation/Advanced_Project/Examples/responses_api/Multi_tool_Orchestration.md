# 🔍 What is Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)?

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** is a technique that improves the quality of answers from AI models by combining:

1. **Retrieval** – Finding relevant information from external sources (like PDFs, websites, or databases).
2. **Generation** – Using a language model (like GPT) to generate a smart, coherent response based on the retrieved information.

## 💡 Simple Analogy

> Imagine you’re asked a question about World War II.  
> Instead of answering from memory, you:
> - First open a book or search Google (retrieval),
> - Then summarize and explain the answer (generation).

That’s exactly what **RAG** does — the AI first fetches relevant information and then generates an informed answer.

## 🧠 Why Use RAG?

LLMs (like GPT) have certain limitations:
- They may **hallucinate** or make up answers.
- They can’t **access private or real-time data** out of the box.

So RAG helps solve these by:
- **Retrieving facts** from trusted documents or external databases.
- **Reducing hallucinations** and improving factual accuracy.
- Making answers **more grounded, current, and reliable**.

## 🔗 Real-World Example

**User:** “What is OpenAI’s latest paper on reasoning models?”

**AI using RAG:**
- Searches OpenAI’s research site or internal vector database (retrieval),
- Finds the latest paper or data,
- Summarizes the main points clearly (generation).

## ✅ Benefits of RAG

- ✅ Real-time or custom knowledge access
- ✅ Fewer hallucinations
- ✅ Easily updatable by changing source documents
- ✅ Better explainability and traceability

# 🤖 Multi-Tool Orchestration with RAG using OpenAI's Responses API

This guide explains how to build **dynamic, multi-tool workflows** using OpenAI’s **Responses API**, especially with a **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** approach.

## 🔍 What Is It?

- It helps us route user queries **intelligently**:
  - To **function calls**
  - To **web search tools**
  - To **document/vector retrieval tools** (like Pinecone)
