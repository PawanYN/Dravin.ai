# 🧠 Vector Search & Qdrant: A Developer's Guide

---

## 📌 0. Root Problem: Why Traditional Search Fails?

In many modern applications, users want **semantic search**, not just exact matches.

### ❌ Traditional (keyword) search:
- Only matches exact words.
- Cannot understand **meaning** or **context**.
- Example:
  - Search: `"How to get salvation?"`
  - Misses: `"Path to liberation"`, `"Mukti process"`, etc.

### ✅ Desired behavior:
- Understand the **semantic meaning** behind queries.
- Return **contextually relevant results**, even if keywords differ.

**➡️ This is where VECTORS and VECTOR DATABASES come in.**

## 🔢 1. What Are Vectors and Embeddings?

### 🔹 Embedding:
An **embedding** is a numerical representation of data (text, image, audio) in vector form, generated by an AI model.

- Example:
  - `"Krishna is supreme"` → `[0.12, -0.33, 0.98, ..., 0.01]` (a 768-dimension vector)

### 🔹 Vector:
A **vector** is just an array of numbers:
```text
[0.1, -0.2, 0.7, ..., 0.04]
```

Two vectors that are **close together** in space mean their original content is **semantically similar**.

## ❓ 2. Why Do We Need a Vector Database?

Once you generate embeddings, you need to:

- 🔍 Store millions of vectors
- ⚡ Find **similar vectors quickly** (nearest neighbors)
- 🧠 Filter with metadata (like language, tags)

### ❌ Not good with traditional DBs (Postgres, Mongo):
- No optimized support for vector similarity
- Too slow for large-scale vector search

### ✅ Use a Vector Database:
- Specially built for **vector similarity search**
- Fast algorithms like **HNSW**
- Support for **payload filtering** (e.g., `lang = 'Hindi'`)

**➡️ Qdrant is one of the best vector databases for this job.**

## 🚀 3. What is Qdrant?

Qdrant is an **open-source vector search engine**, built in **Rust** for high performance.

### ✅ Key Features:
- Fast **Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN)** search
- Store vectors with **metadata (payloads)**
- Support for **filters + semantic search**
- REST API, gRPC, and Python SDK
- Easy to run via Docker or Qdrant Cloud

## 📦 4. Core Concepts in Qdrant

| Concept       | Description                                      |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Collection** | A group of vectors (like a table).               |
| **Point**      | A single vector entry with ID and payload.       |
| **Vector**     | A numeric array (e.g., from an embedding model). |
| **Payload**    | Metadata (e.g., title, tags, lang).              |
| **Filter**     | Query condition on metadata.                     |

## ⚙️ 5. Setup & Installation

### 🐳 Run Qdrant with Docker
```bash
docker run -p 6333:6333 qdrant/qdrant
```

### 🐍 Install Python Client
```bash
pip install qdrant-client
```

---

## 🧪 6. Using Qdrant (Python Example)

### 🛠️ Create Client
```python
from qdrant_client import QdrantClient
client = QdrantClient(host="localhost", port=6333)
```

### 🔧 Create Collection
```python
client.recreate_collection(
    collection_name="my_docs",
    vectors_config={"size": 768, "distance": "Cosine"}
)
```

### 📥 Insert a Vector
```python
from qdrant_client.models import PointStruct

embedding = [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, ...]  # vector from embedding model
payload = {"title": "Bhagavad-gita", "lang": "Sanskrit"}

client.upsert(
    collection_name="my_docs",
    points=[
        PointStruct(id=1, vector=embedding, payload=payload)
    ]
)
```

### 🔍 Search
```python
results = client.search(
    collection_name="my_docs",
    query_vector=embedding,
    limit=5
)

for res in results:
    print(res.payload["title"], res.score)
```
