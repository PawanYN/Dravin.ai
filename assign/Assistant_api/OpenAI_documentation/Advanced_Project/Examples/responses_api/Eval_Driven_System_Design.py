Eval Driven System Design - From Prototype to Production

A comprehensive framework for building AI systems using evaluation-driven development,
following the methodology from OpenAI's cookbook for creating production-grade
autonomous systems that replace labor-intensive human workflows.

This implementation demonstrates the complete lifecycle:
1. Understanding the Problem & Assembling Examples
2. Building End-to-End V0 System
3. Labeling Data & Building Initial Evals
4. Mapping Evals to Business Metrics
5. Progressive System & Eval Improvement
6. QA Process & Ongoing Improvements

Use Case: Receipt Processing System
- Replace manual receipt review workflow
- Extract structured data from receipt images
- Make audit decisions based on business rules
- Minimize human intervention while maintaining accuracy
